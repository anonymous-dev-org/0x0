Terminal Agent Enterprise is for organizations that want to ensure that their code and data never leaves their infrastructure. It can do this by using a centralized config that integrates with your SSO and internal AI gateway.

:::note
Terminal Agent does not store any of your code or context data.
:::

To get started with Terminal Agent Enterprise:

1. Do a trial internally with your team.
2. **<a href={email}>Contact us</a>** to discuss pricing and implementation options.

---

## Trial

Terminal Agent is open source and does not store any of your code or context data, so your developers can simply [get started](/docs/) and carry out a trial.

---

### Data handling

**Terminal Agent does not store your code or context data.** All processing happens locally or through direct API calls to your AI provider.

This means that as long as you are using a provider you trust, or an internal
AI gateway, you can use Terminal Agent securely.

The only caveat here is the optional `/share` feature.

---

#### Sharing conversations

If a user enables the `/share` feature, the conversation and the data associated with it are sent to the service we use to host these share pages at 0x0.ai.

The data is currently served through our CDN's edge network, and is cached on the edge near your users.

We recommend you disable this for your trial.

```json title="0x0.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://0x0.ai/config.json",
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

[Learn more about sharing](/docs/share).

---

### Code ownership

**You own all code produced by Terminal Agent.** There are no licensing restrictions or ownership claims.

---

## Pricing

We use a per-seat model for Terminal Agent Enterprise. If you have your own LLM gateway, we do not charge for tokens used. For further details about pricing and implementation options, **<a href={email}>contact us</a>**.

---

## Deployment

Once you have completed your trial and you are ready to use Terminal Agent at
your organization, you can **<a href={email}>contact us</a>** to discuss
pricing and implementation options.

---

### Central Config

We can set up Terminal Agent to use a single central config for your entire organization.

This centralized config can integrate with your SSO provider and ensures all users access only your internal AI gateway.

---

### SSO integration

Through the central config, Terminal Agent can integrate with your organization's SSO provider for authentication.

This allows Terminal Agent to obtain credentials for your internal AI gateway through your existing identity management system.

---

### Internal AI gateway

With the central config, Terminal Agent can also be configured to use only your internal AI gateway.

You can also disable all other AI providers, ensuring all requests go through your organization's approved infrastructure.

---

### Self-hosting

While we recommend disabling the share pages to ensure your data never leaves
your organization, we can also help you self-host them on your infrastructure.

This is currently on our roadmap. If you're interested, **<a href={email}>let us know</a>**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can we use our own private NPM registry?</summary>

Terminal Agent supports private npm registries through Bun's native `.npmrc` file support. If your organization uses a private registry, such as JFrog Artifactory, Nexus, or similar, ensure developers are authenticated before running Terminal Agent.

To set up authentication with your private registry:

```bash
npm login --registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/
```

This creates `~/.npmrc` with authentication details. Terminal Agent will automatically
pick this up.

:::caution
You must be logged into the private registry before running Terminal Agent.
:::

Alternatively, you can manually configure a `.npmrc` file:

```bash title="~/.npmrc"
registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/
//your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Developers must be logged into the private registry before running Terminal Agent to ensure packages can be installed from your enterprise registry.
