description: Use Terminal Agent in GitLab issues and merge requests.
---

Terminal Agent integrates with your GitLab workflow through your GitLab CI/CD pipeline or with GitLab Duo.

In both cases, Terminal Agent will run on your GitLab runners.

---

## GitLab CI

Terminal Agent works in a regular GitLab pipeline. You can build it into a pipeline as a [CI component](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/)

Here we are using a community-created CI/CD component for Terminal Agent — [nagyv/gitlab-0x0](https://gitlab.com/nagyv/gitlab-0x0).

---

### Features

- **Use custom configuration per job**: Configure Terminal Agent with a custom configuration directory, for example `./config/#custom-directory` to enable or disable functionality per Terminal Agent invocation.
- **Minimal setup**: The CI component sets up Terminal Agent in the background, you only need to create the Terminal Agent configuration and the initial prompt.
- **Flexible**: The CI component supports several inputs for customizing its behavior

---

### Setup

1. Store your Terminal Agent authentication JSON as a File type CI environment variables under **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Variables**. Make sure to mark them as "Masked and hidden".
2. Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

   ```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
   include:
     - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/nagyv/gitlab-0x0/0x0@2
       inputs:
         config_dir: ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/0x0-config
         auth_json: $ZEROXZERO_AUTH_JSON # The variable name for your Terminal Agent authentication JSON
         command: optional-custom-command
         message: "Your prompt here"
   ```

For more inputs and use cases [check out the docs](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/nagyv/gitlab-0x0) for this component.

## GitLab Duo

Terminal Agent integrates with your GitLab workflow.
Mention `@0x0` in a comment, and Terminal Agent will execute tasks within your GitLab CI pipeline.

---

### Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask Terminal Agent to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask Terminal Agent to fix an issue or implement a feature.
  It will create a new branch and raise a merge request with the changes.
- **Secure**: Terminal Agent runs on your GitLab runners.

### Setup

Terminal Agent runs in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline, here's what you'll need to set it up:

:::tip
Check out the [**GitLab docs**](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agent_assistant/) for up to date instructions.
:::

1.  Configure your GitLab environment
2.  Set up CI/CD
3.  Get an AI model provider API key
4.  Create a service account
5.  Configure CI/CD variables
6.  Create a flow config file, here's an example:

        <details>

    <summary>Flow configuration</summary>

    ```yaml
    image: node:22-slim
    commands:
      - echo "Installing 0x0"
      - npm install --global @anonymous-dev/0x0
      - echo "Installing glab"
      - export GITLAB_TOKEN=$GITLAB_TOKEN_ZEROXZERO
      - apt-get update --quiet && apt-get install --yes curl wget gpg git && rm --recursive --force /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      - curl --silent --show-error --location "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upciti/wakemeops/main/assets/install_repository" | bash
      - apt-get install --yes glab
      - echo "Configuring glab"
      - echo $GITLAB_HOST
      - echo "Creating Terminal Agent auth configuration"
      - mkdir --parents ~/.local/share/0x0
      - |
        cat > ~/.local/share/0x0/auth.json << EOF
        {
          "anthropic": {
            "type": "api",
            "key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
          }
        }
        EOF
      - echo "Configuring git"
      - git config --global user.email "0x0@gitlab.com"
      - git config --global user.name "Terminal Agent"
      - echo "Testing glab"
      - glab issue list
      - echo "Running Terminal Agent"
      - |

        Please execute the requested task using the available GitLab tools.
        Be thorough in your analysis and provide clear explanations.

        <important>
        Please use the glab CLI to access data from GitLab. The glab CLI has already been authenticated. You can run the corresponding commands.

        If you are asked to summarize an MR or issue or asked to provide more information then please post back a note to the MR/Issue so that the user can see it.
        You don't need to commit or push up changes, those will be done automatically based on the file changes you make.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use Terminal Agent in GitLab.

:::tip
You can configure to use a different trigger phrase than `@0x0`.
:::

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitLab issue.

  ```
  @0x0 explain this issue
  ```

  Terminal Agent will read the issue and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitLab issue, say:

  ```
  @0x0 fix this
  ```

  Terminal Agent will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a merge request with the changes.

- **Review merge requests**

  Leave the following comment on a GitLab merge request.

  ```
  @0x0 review this merge request
  ```

  Terminal Agent will review the merge request and provide feedback.
