Launch an agent to handle complex, multistep tasks autonomously.

Available agents and the tools they have access to:
{agents}

When using the Task tool, you must specify:
- `mode`: either `subtask` or `handoff` (required)
- `agent`: target agent name
- `description`: short objective

Mode behavior:
- `subtask`: delegate work to another agent and return the result back to the current agent.
- `handoff`: permanently transfer control to another agent in the current session.

When to use `mode: "subtask"`:
- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Task tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description="Check the file", prompt="/check-file path/to/file.py")

When to use `mode: "handoff"`:
- When the current agent should stop and a different agent should take over in the same session.
- Provide a clear handoff objective in `description`.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Search tool (mode: "files") instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Search tool (mode: "content") instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above


Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses (only for `subtask` mode)
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result. The output includes a task_id you can reuse later to continue the same agent session.
3. In `subtask` mode, each agent invocation starts with a fresh context unless you provide `task_id` to resume the same agent session (which continues with its previous messages and tool outputs). When starting fresh, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent. Tell it how to verify its work if possible (e.g., relevant test commands).
6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.

Example usage (NOTE: The agents below are fictional examples for illustration only - use the actual agents listed above):

<example_agent_descriptions>
"code-reviewer": use this agent after you are done writing a significant piece of code
"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_description>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent
</example>

<example>
assistant: I should transfer this session to the planner agent.
assistant: Uses Task with mode="handoff", agent="planner", description="Take over and create an implementation plan for the user request"
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the with the greeting-responder agent"
</example>
